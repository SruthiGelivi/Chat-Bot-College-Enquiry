This project was to develop a college enquiry chat bot which answers any queries posed by students like professor’s contact details, course related questions and location of University buildings, book an appointment with professors etc. 

The chat bot application helps the students to access the university related information from anywhere with internet connection. This automatic answering system reduces burden on University officials providing information to students and also reduces the dependency on humans to answer the queries.

The system also has frequently asked questions which will be added by admin for user’s convenience. Admin can view the user conversation on his home screen and add frequently asked questions to user's home page for direct access to users. The chat bot also provides a link to the user if the user wants to book an appointment with Professors. The appointment booking page helps students book an appointment with the professor in convenient time slots. 

We have used Agile Model to develop the application. Agile model helped us to implement the project in an adaptable way. The project tasks are divided among four increments. We have used ZenHub for the project management. Four milestones are created for each increment and issues are created and assigned to individual team members.
